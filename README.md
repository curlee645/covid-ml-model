# covid-ml-model
In this project, I saught to predict the political leanings of counties in the United States based on their mask usage frequency using a logistic regression model.
Afterwards, I attempted to predict future number of covid cases in each county using a multilinear regression model that took in the political leaning of each county 
and past covid case data.
